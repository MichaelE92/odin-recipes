# 📦 My Recipe Project

I am using HTML to make a project regarding recipes. This is practice for HTML only and aims to further cement my understanding of best practices learned so far.

I am using Ubuntu for terminal navigation and file creation. Git and GitHub alongside one another for commits and displaying of the project. Finally, VSCode for text editing.

## 🌟 Highlights

- Reinforcing HTML understanding and the use of the terminal for navigation, file creation, git interactions and more.
