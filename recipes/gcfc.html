        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Garlic Chicken Fried Chicken is an easy, flavour-packed fried-chicken dish where thin chicken breasts are coated in a seasoned breading spiced with garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper, then dipped in an egg-milk wash, dredged in flour and crumbs, and fried until golden and juicy. It’s a great weeknight meal — quick to prepare, crispy outside and tender inside, with a bold garlic-forward flavour that makes it a crowd-pleaser.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ cup milk</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin</li>
                <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the dry ingredients until evenly coated.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.</li>
                <br>
            </ol>
